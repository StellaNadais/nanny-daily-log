# Nanny Log Trail Audit

## Problem

Caregiving work involves constant movement, shifting schedules, and overlapping responsibilities.
Arrival times, mileage between families, and back-to-back bookings are often tracked mentally or reconstructed later.

This creates recurring problems:
- inconsistent or forgotten arrival times
- miscalculated or untracked mileage
- accidental double booking
- stress around proving hours worked or explaining discrepancies

These issues are not caused by lack of effort, but by the absence of a reliable system that captures what actually happens during the day.

## Solution

This project is a guided daily logging system built to function as an audit trail for caregiving work.

Instead of planning or forecasting, the system focuses on **documenting events as they occur**:
- when work begins
- how time is spent
- where movement happens
- what responsibilities are completed

The interface breaks the day into fixed sections and guides logging step by step.
Structure and motion are used to reduce decision-making and prevent information from being held in memory.

The system prioritizes:
- accuracy over optimization
- documentation over productivity
- clarity over completeness

## Process

The system was built by identifying frequent failure points and designing directly around them:

1. **Repeated lateness → explicit arrival logging**
2. **Mileage miscalculation → dedicated movement tracking**
3. **Double booking → single-day focus with visible completion**
4. **Mental overload → guided, one-section-at-a-time flow**

Rather than adding features,
